This is the code repository for [PyTorch 1.x Reinforcement Learning Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/in/data/pytorch-1-0-reinforcement-learning-cookbook), published by Packt.

**Over 60 recipes to design, develop, and deploy self-learning AI models using Python**

## What is this book about?
	
This book presents practical solutions to the most common reinforcement learning problems. The recipes in this book will help you understand the fundamental concepts to develop popular RL algorithms. You will gain practical experience in the RL domain using the modern offerings of the PyTorch 1.x library.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Use Q-learning and the state–action–reward–state–action (SARSA) algorithm to solve various Gridworld problems
* Develop a multi-armed bandit algorithm to optimize display advertising
* Scale up learning and control processes using Deep Q-Networks
* Simulate Markov Decision Processes, OpenAI Gym environments, and other common control problems
* Select and build RL models, evaluate their performance, and optimize and deploy them
* Use policy gradient methods to solve continuous RL problems

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. 

The code will look like the following:
```
>>> def random_policy():
...     action = torch.multinomial(torch.ones(n_action), 1).item()
...     return action
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Machine learning engineers, data scientists and AI researchers looking for quick solutions to different reinforcement learning problems will find this book useful. Although prior knowledge of machine learning concepts is required, experience with PyTorch will be useful but not necessary.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-9).
